# Mapbox GL JS Playground

Playground that allows you to specify the map's center point and zoom level, select your desired map style, add GeoJSON or tileset data to your map, and apply simple styling options. The playground pulls in these styling configurations and provides the corresponding Mapbox GL JS starter code snippet that you can use in your application. For example, you can paste the code snippet into https://jsbin.com/ to quickly have a working test case.

To get started, download this repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies. You can then run `npm start` to run the playground locally.
